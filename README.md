# Laptop Setup

## Execution 

This repository contains a bash script for setting up a front-end dev Macbook.

To run the script, first set the permissions on the **setup.sh** by running:

```
chmod +x ./setup.sh
```

Then execute the script by navigating to the project root and run:

```
./setup.sh
```

## About

The installer will run through a series of standard tools and install them onto your machine. Each tool will ask if you want it, before it is installed. Respond to each question with either `y` Yes, or `n` No. Replying with No will skip the install.
